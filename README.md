# Frontend Boilerplate
Quick-start frontend developer boilerplate. Modular folder structure, useful sass mixins, flexbox-grid and much more to get started.

## Get started
1. `git clone https://github.com/l4ci/Starterkit.git www`
2. `cd www`
3. `yarn` (This requires [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to be installed first)
4. `gulp watch` (This will open your browser and setup BrowserSync)
5. Read index page, that just opened.
6. Start coding within the `/src` folder. Every change should auto-compile into `/dist` and be displayed right away.
